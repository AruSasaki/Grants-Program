### Milestone 1 â€” Web Service Development

- **Estimated duration:** 3 month
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

Initially, we plan to develop a bidirectional message protocol on Astar.
Since the front side is somewhat done, it is the blockchain side, but programmed to automatically list the destination wallet address, recipient wallet address, and IPFS address on the chain.
The message body will be developed to be automatically stored in the IPFS.

  
## Future Plans

Our short-term plan is to first complete the protocol, create an SDK and API, and make it available to various Web3 services as a top priority.
We will also develop and offer Dapp on our own, as there are no examples at first.

Initially, development will be done on Astar, a startup chain (generous support for developers, Founder is Japanese and easy to communicate with) to create examples, and then the examples will be used as a basis to be incorporated into Dapps for ETH and other chains.
Ultimately, we aim to be able to support all chains and create a Web3 communication infrastructure.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

  We are just starting to develop and there are quite a few things we don't know. Even if we are not selected by Grant for this application, we would like to know where we should improve.
I intend to spend my life trying my hand at this field.
Let's create the era of Web3 together.

We found this from Astar.
