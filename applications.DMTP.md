## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:
DMTP is Decentralized Message Transfer Protocol that enables any Dapps or smart contracts to send and receive messages blockchain and platform independent.
This is bidirectional message protocol connecting Dapps and users
It can be easily integrated into any Dapps and used for customer support, etc.

This project is initially going to be implemented in Astar, one of Polkadot's para-chains.
Because we believe that the time is coming for multi-chains. By building on Astar, we will be supporting Substrate, which will naturally improve the Polkadot ecosystem.

The reason we decided to start this project is that there is still no means of communication on the Web3.
Communication is still mainly through Dapps, which require registration of e-mail addresses, and messaging tools such as Telegram.
We can't communicate  with our wallet address.
We solve it.
And I believe it is essential for the spread of Web3 that it can be used on smartphones and that notifications can be sent.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

This is just a Mockup of our project(https://dmtp.tech/)
But we will ask to improve this to UI desiner.

And we didn't develop other function.
But we're going to develop on Astar. So this project will support EVM and WASM.

We're developping this by React and Solidity right now.

We will create APIs and SDKs that can be integrated into any Dapps or wallets.
The DMTP is the foundation of the Web3 message.
We will also create our own Dapps and make examples in the early days.

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  Our project will be a protocol used for any Dapps. Therefore, we believe that it will stand like Layer 2.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
　Dapps is most important target for us.But Wallet also our target.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
　The DMTP will be the communication infrastructure in Web3.
There will always be a need for people who want to communicate by wallet address and do not want to use centralized communication tools.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
　No

  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
　There are EPNS on Ethereum, and Status which is wallet with messaging.

## Future Plans

Our short-term plan is to first complete the protocol, create an SDK and API, and make it available to various Web3 services as a top priority.
We will also develop and offer Dapp on our own, as there are no examples at first.

Initially, development will be done on Astar, a startup chain (generous support for developers, Founder is Japanese and easy to communicate with) to create examples, and then the examples will be used as a basis to be incorporated into Dapps for ETH and other chains.
Ultimately, we aim to be able to support all chains and create a Web3 communication infrastructure.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

  We are just starting to develop and there are quite a few things we don't know. Even if we are not selected by Grant for this application, we would like to know where we should improve.
I intend to spend my life trying my hand at this field.
Let's create the era of Web3 together.
